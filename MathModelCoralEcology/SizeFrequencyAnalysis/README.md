## Influence of Coral Associated Fish and Invertebrae (CAFI) on Coral Population Size-Frequency:

A study on the influence of CAFI on the population dynamics of coral reef systems. I, along with my academic advisor [Scott McKinley](https://www.stochastics-lab.net/smck) and his colleagues [Craig Osenberg](https://www.ecology.uga.edu/directory/craig-w-osenberg/) and [Elizabeth Hamman](https://inside.smcm.edu/directory/elizabeth-hamman) (both experts in Ecology), develop and analyze a deterministic mathematical model that describes the settlement and post-settlement processes of corals and CAFI in a finite system. We pair this with a stochastic version of model, and observe significant qualitative similarities.

Through rigorous mathematical analysis of the model, we explain certain qualities of the population dynamics.

Through numerical techniques, we simulate and visualize coral populations that emerge from CAFI interactions.

Here is a [talk](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/MathModelCoralEcology/SizeFrequencyAnalysis/Coral_CAFI_Grad_Student_Colloquium.pdf) that breifly describes some of the work. More to come with my dissertation...
