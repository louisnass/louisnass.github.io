# Probability Theory II
## Final Project:

The goal is to estimate parameters related to fish settlement. 

Labelled "settlers from the black lagoon" we define a toy problem that models fish settlement on a 1-dimensional ocean floor. 

"Pic of Settlers from black lagoon"

Using "true value" parameters, we then generate data that simulates fish settlement according to our model. Then, we use Bayes' theorem to develop a posterior for the desired parameters from our simulated data. We implement a Metropolis-Hastings to approximate the resulting posterior distributions of the "unknown" parameters in the model.
