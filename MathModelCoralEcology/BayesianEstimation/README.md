# Final Project for Probability Theory II
Here I estimate parameters related to fish settlement. Labelled "Settlers from the black lagoon" we create a toy problem that models fish settlement on a 1-dimensional ocean floor. We then use Bayes' theorem to develop a posterior for the desired parameters and use Metropolis-Hastings to approximate the resulting distributions.
