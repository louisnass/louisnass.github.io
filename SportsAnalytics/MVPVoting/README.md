# Data Analysis
## Final Project:

The goal is to create a model that predicts NBA MVP votes from individual player statistics.

Here I generate a linear model to estimate the number of MVP votes a player will receive given individual performance during the NBA season. I train my model on previous player data, spanning back to the 1980's. I then isolate data from each decade, train new models, and compare predictor influence. The idea is to understand what MVP voters look for in particular players and how style of play has influenced voting. 

Here is my [report](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/SportsAnalytics/MVPVoting/Data_Analysis_Final.pdf) and [final presentation](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/SportsAnalytics/MVPVoting/NBA_MVP_Voting.pdf).
