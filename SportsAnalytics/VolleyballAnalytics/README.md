# Volleyball Workshop
## Data Scraping:

I taught myself how to use R-Selenium in order to data-scrape from JavaScript sites. 

I took on this project to assist my academic advisor Scott McKinley with his summer workshop in [volleyball analytics](https://www.stochastics-lab.net/volleyball-analytics). 

Here I scraped data from [Volleymetrics](https://portal.volleymetrics.hudl.com/#/auth/login) to create data frames from [division 1](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/SportsAnalytics/VolleyballAnalytics/D1_volleyball.csv), [division 2](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/SportsAnalytics/VolleyballAnalytics/D2_volleyball.csv), and [division 3](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/SportsAnalytics/VolleyballAnalytics/D3_volleyball.csv) teams.

Presently, I have collaborated with the Tulane Women's D-1 Volleyball team, as a [volunteer analyst](https://tulanegreenwave.com/sports/womens-volleyball/roster/staff/louis-nass/4683), designing a model for evaluating team and individual digs. Together, we developed a dig-ranking system which has allowed me to define a dig-score and a Markov-Chain model for computing point-win probabilities according to dig-ranks. These tools can be used to scout opposing teams to take advantage of potential weaknesses and avoid strong player or to self-evaluate a team or players for improvement.
