# Volleyball Workshop
## Data Scraping:

I taught myself how to use R-Selenium in order to data-scrape from JavaScript sites. 

I took on this project to assist my academic advisor Scott McKinley with his summer workshop in [volleyball analytics](https://www.stochastics-lab.net/volleyball-analytics). 

Here I scraped data from [Volleymetrics](https://portal.volleymetrics.hudl.com/#/auth/login) to create data frames from [division 1](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/SportsAnalytics/VolleyballAnalytics/D1_volleyball.csv), [division 2](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/SportsAnalytics/VolleyballAnalytics/D2_volleyball.csv), and [division 3](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/SportsAnalytics/VolleyballAnalytics/D3_volleyball.csv) teams.
