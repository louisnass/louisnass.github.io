# Linear Models
## Final Project

The goal is to analyze style of team basketball play throughout various decades, and how different styles translate to victories in the NBA.

Here I create a linear model that predicts team NBA wins using team statistics during an NBA season. I further consider which predictors are most and least effective in producing team wins. Then, I isolate data according to decade, train corresponding models, and compare how style of play has evolved in the NBA.

Here is my [report](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/SportsAnalytics/Wins/Linear_Models_Paper.pdf) and my [presentation](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/SportsAnalytics/Wins/Linear_Models_Presentation.pdf).
