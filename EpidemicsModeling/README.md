# Epidemics Modeling
## Final Project:

The goal is to model a closed population epidemic of a drug-resistant form of Tuberculosis.

I, with assistance from my classmates [Chinwe Orie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-chinwe-orie/) and [Patrick Brandenburg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-brandenburg-a01a12180/), developed an S-I-R-S model that considers drug-resistant and non-resistant forms of TB.

In my [report](https://github.com/louisnass/louisnass.github.io/blob/master/EpidemicsModeling/Drug_Resistant_TB.pdf), I define the model, analyze associated parameters, and describe the numerical solutions to our differential equation system.
